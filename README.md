# UPSchoolAkbankiOSDeveloperBootcamp

For my capstone project for UP School & Akbank iOS Developer Bootcamp, I developed a News application using https://newsapi.org with MVVM design pattern. 

Technologies:
✨ Xcode - Storyboard 
✨ Firebase
✨ SDWebImage
✨ Lottie animations
✨ Side Menu
✨ IQKeyboardManager
✨ Collection view
✨ Table view
✨ URL session
✨ Core Data

In this News app, users can select the new  listed in the home page and go to detail page. In detail page 'click for details' button helps user to navigate detailed page for the selected new, share button helps user to share this app with others and save button saves the new to the search page. When user clicks on the side menu button, all the categories are listed and when clicked home page reloads itself according to selected category. In search page users can see listed news and search related news via searchbar. In profile page users can pick picture from their galery and can switch between dark and light mode. Also they can see their email if they're logged in. An finally, users can logout the app when they click on the 'log out' button.
